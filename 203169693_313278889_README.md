Our functionality:
* There is a red monster (with some kind of mouth), this monster is stronger then the others, it removes 60 points and 2 lifes.
* There is a star that moves randomly like a drunk guy in the Baraka club. Eating it worth 50 points.
* There is a clock symbol, after "eating" this clock, the monsters and the star is getting really slow for 10 seconds.
